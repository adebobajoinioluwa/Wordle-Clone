This is a clone of the wordle game, web app that was sold to the New York Times. It was made using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla Javascript.
Below is the instruction on how to play the game: 
a. There is a secret five letter word chosen
b. Players have six guesses to figure out the secret word. After six guesses, they lose
c. If the player guesses a letter that is in the right place, it is shown as green
d. If the player guesses a letter that is in the word but not in the right place, it is shown as yellow
f. It does account for however many of the letter exist in the word. For example, if the player guesses "SPOOL" and the word is "OVERT", one "O" is shown as yellow and the second one is not.
g. If the player guesses the right word, the player wins and the game is over.
Note: This application doesn't work well on mobile phones.
